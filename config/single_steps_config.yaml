    #########---------------

    # If don't want to use these options, assign them to "" (unless told otherwise)

    # -s - only report hits overlapping on the same strand
    # -S - only report hits overlapping on opposite strands
    strandedness: "-s"

    # Report the depth at each position in each interval
    depth: "-d"

    # what operations to summarise coverage in each intervals from bed_path? All below are valid strings
    # sum, count, count_distinct, min, max, last
    # median, mode, antimode, stdev, sstdev, collapse
    # distinct, concat, freqasc, freqdesc, first, last
    # If just want per-base coverages, assign to an empty list with []
    operations: ["mean"]

    #1-based - which column should operation be performed on? (with depth = -d & a 6 col BED, this is the 8th column)
    operation_column: 8

    # No need to change these unless necessary

    sorted: "-sorted"
